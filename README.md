## ‚ú® What I Have Learned

Bootstrap is an easy-to-use front-end framework written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing responsive websites. It offers a more effective approach to styling the elements and adding features on the webpage, which would otherwise require more coding with HTML, CSS and JS alone. In this project, I experimented with different basic Bootstrap components and utilities to familiarize myself with Bootstrap class names and the implementation. It's a great addition to my existing knowledge of front-end development.
